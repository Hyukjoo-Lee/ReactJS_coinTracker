## Project Review
- Recoil is a state management library for ReactJS.
- I used the library to manage theme color statement that apply throughout the project.
- It was really easy to utilize because I just needed to change the state declared in Recoil atom instead of modifying states in the components one by one.
- React-query caching feature, which allowed me to load and utilize data fetched by API.
